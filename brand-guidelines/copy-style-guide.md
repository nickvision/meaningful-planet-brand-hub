# Meaningful Planet – Copy Style Guide

**Version:** 1.0
**Last updated:** February 2026
**Applies to:** Milo platform UI, marketing website, transactional emails, help documentation

This guide establishes the rules for all written copy across Meaningful Planet's products and communications. It exists to ensure consistency, professionalism, and clarity – whether the copy is written by a team member, a contractor, or generated by AI.

When in doubt, this document is the source of truth. If you encounter a situation not covered here, flag it for discussion and we'll add a ruling.

---

## 1. Capitalisation

This is the single most visible consistency issue in any product. Follow these rules without exception.

### Title Case

Use title case for elements that name or label a destination, action, or section.

**Where to use it:**

- Page titles and H1 headings (e.g., "SIM Management", "Subscription & Billing")
- Navigation menu items (e.g., "Environmental Impact", "Support & Help")
- Button labels for primary and secondary CTAs (e.g., "Create New User", "Upgrade Plan", "View Invoices in Stripe")
- Card and section headings / H2s (e.g., "SIM Card Information", "Data Usage", "Payment & Invoices")
- Tab labels (e.g., "Profile", "Security", "Notifications")
- Modal and dialog titles (e.g., "Confirm SIM Suspension")
- Column headers in data tables (e.g., "SIM Serial", "Data Plan", "Monthly Spend")
- Page names when referenced in running text (e.g., "Go back to SIM Management")

**Title case rules:**

- Capitalise the first and last word, always
- Capitalise all nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns
- Lowercase articles (a, an, the), coordinating conjunctions (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so), and prepositions of four letters or fewer (in, on, to, for, with, at, by, of) – unless they are the first or last word
- Capitalise both parts of a hyphenated word if both are major words (e.g., "Real-Time Updates"), but keep minor words lowercase (e.g., "Opt-in Settings")

**Examples:**

- ✅ "Transfer Your Existing Number"
- ✅ "Go Back to Subscriptions"
- ✅ "Active Alerts for This Month"
- ❌ "Transfer your existing number" (sentence case on a page title)
- ❌ "GO BACK TO SUBSCRIPTIONS" (all caps – never use)

### Sentence Case

Use sentence case for everything that reads as a phrase, description, or instruction rather than a label or title.

**Where to use it:**

- Page descriptions and subtitles (e.g., "You can see here information about a specific SIM card")
- Form field labels (e.g., "Full name", "Email address", "Phone number")
- Placeholder text in inputs (e.g., "Search by name or email...")
- Tooltip text and inline help
- Status badge text (e.g., "Active", "Suspended", "For activation")
- Alert and banner body text
- Empty state messages (e.g., "No emissions data yet.")
- Error messages (e.g., "Please enter a valid email address")
- Confirmation dialog body text
- Breadcrumb labels that are not page names

**Examples:**

- ✅ Form label: "Email address"
- ✅ Placeholder: "Search SIMs by serial number..."
- ✅ Tooltip: "Suspending a SIM pauses all data and voice services immediately."
- ❌ Form label: "Email Address" (title case on a form label)
- ❌ Placeholder: "Search SIMs By Serial Number..." (title case in placeholder)

### Never Use

- **ALL CAPS** – not for buttons, headings, labels, or emphasis. It reduces readability and feels aggressive. If you need emphasis, use font weight (semibold or bold), not capitalisation.
- **Title case on body text or descriptions** – this is the most common mistake. Subtitles, helper text, and instructional copy are always sentence case.

---

## 2. Punctuation

### Ampersands (&)

Use ampersands only in the following situations:

- **Navigation items and section titles** where the ampersand connects two closely paired concepts and space is constrained (e.g., "Subscription & Billing", "Support & Help")
- **Established brand names or proper nouns** that use an ampersand (e.g., "AT&T")

In all other contexts, write out "and" in full:

- ✅ "Manage your SIMs and subscriptions from one place."
- ✅ "Support & Help" (nav item – ampersand is acceptable)
- ❌ "Manage your SIMs & subscriptions from one place." (body text – use "and")
- ❌ "Create & assign a new user" (button label – use "Create and Assign a New User")

**Rule of thumb:** If it's a short label or heading where the two concepts are a natural pair, the ampersand is fine. If it's a sentence or phrase that someone would read aloud, write "and".

### Full Stops (Periods)

- **Use full stops** on: complete sentences in descriptions, tooltips, empty states, error messages, and body copy
- **Do not use full stops** on: headings, button labels, navigation items, form labels, column headers, stat card labels, or badge text
- **Lists:** If list items are complete sentences, use full stops. If they are fragments or labels, do not

**Examples:**

- ✅ "No emissions data yet." (empty state – complete sentence, full stop)
- ✅ "Upgrade Plan" (button – no full stop)
- ✅ "SIM Management" (heading – no full stop)
- ❌ "Upgrade Plan." (full stop on a button label)
- ❌ "No emissions data yet" (missing full stop on a sentence)

### Commas

- Use the Oxford comma (serial comma) in lists of three or more items: "SIMs, subscriptions, and invoices" – not "SIMs, subscriptions and invoices"
- This avoids ambiguity and is the standard for professional B2B copy

### Hyphens and En Dashes

- **Hyphen (-):** Compound adjectives before a noun (e.g., "real-time updates", "high-priority alert"). Do not hyphenate after the noun ("the update is real time")
- **En dash (–):** Ranges (e.g., "100–1,500 SIMs", "January–March") and as a parenthetical separator where needed (e.g., "Our platform – built for SMEs – gives you full control"). Prefer commas for parenthetical asides in most cases; use the en dash only when commas would create ambiguity
- **Em dash (—):** Do not use. We never use em dashes. Use an en dash with spaces, or restructure the sentence with commas or a full stop

### Apostrophes and Contractions

- **Use contractions** in UI copy and help text. They feel natural and reduce the word count: "You can't suspend a terminated SIM" is better than "You cannot suspend a terminated SIM"
- **Avoid contractions** in formal contexts: legal terms, contracts, official policy documents
- Use curly (smart) apostrophes and quotation marks, not straight ones, in all rendered copy

### British English

All Meaningful Planet copy uses British English exclusively. This applies across every channel – platform UI, website, emails, documentation, and marketing materials.

- **Spelling:** Use British spellings in all cases: "colour" not "color", "organisation" not "organization", "optimise" not "optimize", "analyse" not "analyze", "licence" (noun) not "license", "centre" not "center", "catalogue" not "catalog"
- **-ise vs -ize:** Always use "-ise" endings: "customise", "recognise", "prioritise". Never use the "-ize" variant
- **-our vs -or:** Always use "-our" endings: "colour", "behaviour", "favour", "neighbour"
- **-re vs -er:** Always use "-re" endings: "centre", "metre", "fibre"
- **-ogue vs -og:** Always use "-ogue" endings: "catalogue", "dialogue", "analogue"
- **Double L:** British English doubles the L before suffixes: "travelling", "cancelled", "modelling"
- **Dates:** Day before month: "1 January 2026", not "January 1, 2026"
- **Quotation marks:** Use single quotation marks for primary quotes, double for quotes within quotes: 'He said "hello" and left.'

If in doubt, check the Oxford English Dictionary. When using AI tools to generate copy, always specify British English and review output for US spelling that may slip through.

### Colons

- Use a colon to introduce a list or a value: "Status: Active", "Next steps: confirm your details and submit"
- Capitalise the first word after a colon only if it begins a complete sentence

---

## 3. Numbers and Data Formatting

### General Numbers

- Spell out numbers one through nine in running text: "You have three active SIMs"
- Use numerals for 10 and above: "You have 14 active SIMs"
- Always use numerals in data-heavy UI contexts: stat cards, tables, dashboards, progress indicators. Nobody wants to read "Fourteen" in a stat card – use "14"
- Use commas as thousands separators: "1,250 SIMs", "£12,500"

### Currency

- Use the currency symbol, not the word: "£12.50", not "12.50 GBP" or "twelve pounds fifty"
- Always show two decimal places for monetary values: "£0.00", "£1,250.00"
- Place the currency symbol before the number with no space: "£12.50", not "£ 12.50"

### Percentages

- Use the % symbol with no space: "85%", not "85 %" or "eighty-five percent"
- In stat cards and progress bars, always show one decimal place if the value is not a whole number: "85.3%"

### Dates

- Use the format: "1 January 2026" – day (no leading zero), full month name, four-digit year
- In data tables and compact UI where space is limited: "1 Jan 2026"
- Never use purely numeric formats like "01/01/2026" or "2026-01-01" in user-facing copy – these are ambiguous across locales
- Relative time is acceptable in feeds and activity logs: "2 hours ago", "Yesterday"

### Times

- Use the 24-hour format for the platform UI: "14:30", not "2:30 PM"
- If targeting a predominantly UK/EU audience (which Meaningful Planet does), 24-hour is the professional default

## 4. Voice and Tone

### Brand Voice

Meaningful Planet's voice is **clear, competent, and human**. We manage complex telecoms operations, and our copy should make that complexity feel manageable – not hidden or dumbed down.

Three qualities to aim for in every piece of copy:

- **Direct:** Say what you mean. Avoid filler, hedging, or corporate jargon. "Your SIM has been suspended" is better than "The SIM suspension process has been completed successfully."
- **Helpful:** Anticipate what the user needs to know next. If a SIM is suspended, tell them how to reactivate it. If an action will take time, say how long.
- **Calm:** Even in error states and alerts, the tone should be composed and solution-oriented. Never alarming, never apologetic to the point of undermining confidence.

### Tone by Context

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard / overview | Informative, concise | "3 SIMs are approaching their data limit." |
| Success states | Confirming, brief | "SIM activated successfully." |
| Errors and warnings | Calm, solution-focused | "We couldn't process that request. Check your details and try again." |
| Empty states | Encouraging, guiding | "No support tickets yet. If you need help, create a ticket and our team will respond within 24 hours." |
| Confirmation dialogs | Clear, specific | "Are you sure you want to suspend SIM 8944123456789? This will immediately stop all data and voice services." |
| Marketing / website | Confident, warm | "Manage your entire SIM estate from one place – with full visibility and zero guesswork." |
| Emails (transactional) | Professional, efficient | "Your monthly invoice for January 2026 is ready. View it in your Milo dashboard." |

### Words and Phrases to Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Please be advised that..." | Just state the thing | Corporate filler |
| "Successfully" (in most cases) | Remove it – "SIM activated." is enough | Redundant |
| "Oops!" or "Uh oh!" | "Something went wrong" or be specific | Unprofessional for B2B |
| "Click here" | "View invoices", "Create a ticket" | Inaccessible and vague |
| "Simple" or "easy" | Describe the actual benefit | Patronising if the thing isn't actually simple |
| "Just" (minimising) | Remove it – "Enter your email" not "Just enter your email" | Undermines the instruction |
| "We are currently experiencing..." | "There's an issue with..." or be specific | Bureaucratic |
| "Utilize" | "Use" | Always |

## 5. UI-Specific Copy Patterns

These patterns address recurring copy needs across the Milo platform. Use them as templates.

### Page Titles (H1)

Format: **[Noun or Noun Phrase]** in title case.

- "SIM Management"
- "Subscription & Billing"
- "Environmental Impact"
- "Transfer Your Existing Number"

### Page Descriptions

Format: A single sentence in sentence case with a full stop. Tells the user what they can do here.

- "Manage and monitor all SIM cards across your account."
- "View your subscription details, billing history, and plan options."
- "Track the environmental impact of your connectivity choices."

**Current issues to fix:** Several existing descriptions are phrased as "You can see here information about..." – rewrite these to be action-oriented and direct.

### Button Labels

Format: Title case. Start with a verb. Be specific about what happens.

- ✅ "Create New User"
- ✅ "Upgrade Plan"
- ✅ "View Invoices in Stripe"
- ✅ "Suspend SIM"
- ❌ "Submit" (too vague – submit what?)
- ❌ "Go" (meaningless)
- ❌ "Click Here" (inaccessible)

### Back Links

Format: "← Back to [Section Name]"

Use title case for the section name. Keep it short – "Back to SIM Management", not "Go Back to the SIM Management Page".

**Current pattern to update:** Existing copy uses "← Go Back to [Section]". Shorten to "← Back to [Section]" – more concise, equally clear.

### Confirmation Dialogs

Format:

- **Title:** "Confirm [Action]" in title case (e.g., "Confirm SIM Suspension")
- **Body:** Sentence case. State what will happen, including consequences. "Suspending SIM 8944123456789 will immediately stop all data and voice services. You can reactivate it later."
- **Primary button:** The action verb matching the title (e.g., "Suspend SIM")
- **Secondary button:** "Cancel"

**Current pattern to update:** Existing dialogs use "Are you sure that you want to..." – this is indirect. Lead with the consequence, not the question.

### Empty States

Format: Sentence case. Two parts – what's empty + what to do about it.

- "No SIMs found. Adjust your filters or create a new SIM plan."
- "No support tickets yet. Create a ticket if you need help – our team typically responds within 24 hours."
- "No emissions data available. Data will appear here once your SIMs are active."

### Error Messages

Format: Sentence case. State what went wrong + how to fix it.

- "Enter a valid email address."
- "This SIM can't be suspended because an action is already in progress. Try again in a few minutes."
- "We couldn't save your changes. Check the highlighted fields and try again."

Never blame the user ("You entered an invalid email"). State the requirement or the issue neutrally.

### Tooltips and Inline Help

Format: Sentence case. One to two sentences maximum. End with a full stop.

- "Suspending a SIM pauses all data and voice services immediately. The SIM can be reactivated at any time."
- "This is the date your current contract term ends. Contact your account manager to discuss renewal options."

### Status Badges

Format: Sentence case, no full stop.

- "Active"
- "Suspended"
- "For activation"
- "Action in progress"
- "Terminated"

## 6. Terminology

Use these terms consistently across all channels. Do not alternate between synonyms.

| Preferred Term | Do Not Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SIM | SIM card (unless first mention needs clarification) | "SIM" is sufficient after first use |
| eSIM | e-SIM, ESIM, E-SIM | Always "eSIM" – lowercase e, uppercase SIM |
| SIM estate | SIM fleet, SIM pool | "Estate" is our standard term for a customer's collection of SIMs |
| Subscription | Plan, package, bundle | Use "subscription" for the billing entity; "plan" only when referring to the data plan tier |
| Data plan | Tariff, data package | "Data plan" for the specific allowance tier |
| Activate | Turn on, enable, provision | For SIM activation |
| Suspend | Pause, disable, deactivate | For temporarily stopping service |
| Reactivate | Resume, unsuspend, re-enable | For restoring a suspended SIM |
| Terminate | Cancel, delete, decommission | For permanent removal from service |
| Support ticket | Case, request, issue | "Support ticket" across platform and comms |
| Dashboard | Home, overview, landing page | "Dashboard" for the main summary view |

## 7. Email Copy Guidelines

Transactional and notification emails should follow the same voice and tone principles, with these additional rules:

### Subject Lines

- Title case
- Clear and specific – the user should know the content without opening the email
- Keep under 60 characters where possible
- ✅ "Your January 2026 Invoice Is Ready"
- ✅ "SIM 8944123456789 Has Been Suspended"
- ❌ "Important Update Regarding Your Account" (vague)
- ❌ "Action Required!" (alarmist)

### Email Body

- Lead with the key information – what happened or what the user needs to do
- Use sentence case for body copy
- Include a clear CTA button in title case: "View Your Invoice", "Go to Dashboard"
- Keep emails short – ideally under 150 words for transactional messages
- Sign off with "The Meaningful Planet Team" – not individual names unless it's a personal outreach

---

## 8. Website Copy Guidelines

Marketing and informational pages on the Meaningful Planet website should follow brand voice principles with slightly more warmth and personality than the platform UI.

- **Headlines (H1):** Title case. Can be punchier and more benefit-driven than platform headings. "Manage Your SIM Estate with Confidence" rather than "SIM Management".
- **Subheadings (H2, H3):** Title case.
- **Body copy:** Sentence case. Can use slightly longer sentences than UI copy, but still aim for clarity over cleverness.
- **CTAs:** Title case. Action-oriented. "Start Your Free Trial", "Talk to Our Team", "See Milo in Action".
- **No jargon without context:** If you use a term like "PAC code" or "eSIM provisioning", explain it briefly or link to a help article.

---

## 9. Accessibility and Inclusive Language

### Accessibility

- Never rely on colour alone to convey meaning – always pair with text or an icon
- Link text must describe the destination: "View your January invoice", not "Click here"
- Image alt text should be descriptive and concise – describe what the image shows, not what it is ("Bar chart showing monthly data usage by SIM" not "Chart")
- Form fields must always have visible labels – never rely on placeholder text alone

### Inclusive Language

- Use "they/them" as the default singular pronoun when the user's gender is unknown
- Avoid gendered terms: "staffing" not "manpower", "workforce" not "manpower"
- Write for a global English-speaking audience – avoid idioms, slang, or culturally specific references that may not translate
- Do not use ableist language: "check" not "see below", "select" not "hit"
